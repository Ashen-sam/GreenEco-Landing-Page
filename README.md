### Resources

- I’ve used the smooth scrolling animation from my previous portfolio project, where I implemented Lenis for smooth scroll experience. I also reused the page loading animations I built earlier using AnimatePresence, since they were already optimized and worked well for this setup.

### Improvements

- I added some smooth animations with Framer Motion to make the pages feel nicer.
- Used Lenis to make the scrolling smoother on all devices.
- Cleaned up some components to make the code easier to understand.
- Improved the responsive design so it looks better on tablets and phones.
- In mobile tablet version changed the background ,beacuse for better ux.
- Adjusted some UI parts in smaller devices for better experience.
